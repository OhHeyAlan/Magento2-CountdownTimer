# Magento2-CountdownTimer
This is just a test module for the moment will keep working on this little project when i get time.


# Current issues and to dos:
1. Fix so the dates work correctly
2. The delivery date is not updated will need to update when timer reaches 0.
3. Would like to change the minutes to include hours.
4. Would be good to get a shipping time from backend either from products or from shipping method.
5. Use magento time rather than PHP
6. Not sure about summer time and how this will work.
7. I will work a bit on this however and keep improving.
